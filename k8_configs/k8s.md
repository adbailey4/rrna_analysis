# Pipelines


## Supervised 
* Probability sweep, high_freq_high_delta and all_kmers are all supervised training routines.

### Probability sweep
* test if changes in probability threshold for kmers changes the accuracy of supervised predictions

### high_freq_high_delta
* train on only the high frequency and high delta modifications

### all_kmers
* attempt to learn all kmer distributions from sample

### gaussian_distribution_testing
* Testing a minimum standard deviation along with using mean/sd or median/mad as gaussian parameters
